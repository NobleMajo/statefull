# statefull
Statfull is a stateful websocket node server system behind a stateless http api.
This enables high availability and fast scoped user-to-user communication.

# high availability
The high availability is ensured by the scalable stateless api front and the almost endless expansion of websocket node servers.

# fast communication
Fast user-to-user communication is made possible by controlling the user connection to specific websocket nodes.

# WIP
An example project and description for the software components (node, api and client) and the protocol will come in the future.
